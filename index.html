		<h1> About Grandvideo</h1>
		<p> Grandvideo started when I realized that my Grandparents had <span class="emph">decades of stories</span> from before I was born, stories I'd never heard, stories I wanted my kids and grandkids to hear one day. I believe one of the best ways to honor your family is to give them a platform to share their experiences. Since my grandparents live far away, I don't often get to sit in the living room and listen. I traveled to Texas, made my first documentary, and immediately wanted to do this for others. </p>
